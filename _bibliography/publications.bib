  abstract = {Detecting the anomaly of human behavior is paramount to timely recognizing endangering situations, such as street fights or elderly falls. However, anomaly detection is complex, since anomalous events are rare and because it is an open set recognition task, i.e., what is anomalous at inference has not been observed at training. We propose COSKAD, a novel model which encodes skeletal human motion by an efficient graph convolutional network and learns to COntract SKeletal kinematic embeddings onto a latent hypersphere of minimum volume for Anomaly Detection. We propose and analyze three latent space designs for COSKAD: the commonly-adopted Euclidean, and the new spherical-radial and hyperbolic volumes. All three variants outperform the state-of-the-art, including video-based techniques, on the ShangaiTechCampus, the Avenue, and on the most recent UBnormal dataset, for which we contribute novel skeleton annotations and the selection of human-related videos. The source code and dataset will be released upon acceptance.}

abstract = {Few-shot fine-grained classification and person search appear as distinct tasks and literature has treated them separately. But a closer look unveils important similarities: both tasks target categories that can only be discriminated by specific object details; and the relevant models should generalize to new categories, not seen during training. We propose a novel unified Query-Guided Network (QGN) applicable to both tasks. QGN consists of a Query-guided Siamese-Squeeze-and-Excitation subnetwork which re-weights both the query and gallery features across all network layers, a Query-guided Region Proposal subnetwork for query-specific localisation, and a Query-guided Similarity subnetwork for metric learning. QGN improves on a few recent few-shot fine-grained datasets, outperforming other techniques on CUB by a large margin. QGN also performs competitively on the person search CUHK-SYSU and PRW datasets, where we perform in-depth analysis.}

abstract = {Considering the increasing aging of the population, multi-device monitoring of the activities of daily living (ADL) of older people becomes crucial to support independent living and early detection of symptoms of mental illnesses, such as depression and Alzheimer’s disease. Anomalies can anticipate the diagnosis of these pathologies in the patient’s normal behavior, such as reduced hygiene, changes in sleep habits, and fewer social interactions. These abnormalities are often subtle and hard to detect. Especially using non-intrusive monitoring devices might cause anomaly detectors to generate false alarms or ignore relevant clues. This limitation may hinder their usage by caregivers. Furthermore, the notion of abnormality here is context and patient-dependent, thus requiring untrained approaches. To reduce these problems, we propose a self-supervised model for multi-sensor time series signals based on Hyperbolic uncertainty for Anomaly Detection, which we dub HypAD. HypAD estimates uncertainty end-to-end, thanks to hyperbolic neural networks, and integrates it into the ”classic” notion of reconstruction loss in anomaly detection. Based on hyperbolic uncertainty, HypAD introduces the principle of a detectable anomaly. HypAD assesses whether it is sure about the input signal and fails to reconstruct it because it is anomalous or whether the high reconstruction loss is due to the model uncertainty, e.g., a complex but regular signal (cf. this parallels the residual model error upon training). The proposed solution has been incorporated into an end-to-end ADL monitoring system for elderly patients in retirement homes, developed within a funded project leveraging an interdisciplinary consortium of computer scientists, engineers, and geriatricians. Healthcare professionals were involved in the design and verification process to foster trust in the system. In addition, the system has been equipped with explainability features.}

  abstract={The progress in modelling time series and, more generally, sequences of structured-data has recently revamped research in anomaly detection. The task stands for identifying abnormal behaviours in financial series, IT systems, aerospace measurements, and the medical domain, where anomaly detection may aid in isolating cases of depression and attend the elderly. Anomaly detection in time series is a complex task since anomalies are rare due to highly non-linear temporal correlations and since the definition of anomalous is sometimes subjective. Here we propose the novel use of Hyperbolic uncertainty for Anomaly Detection (HypAD). HypAD learns self-supervisedly to reconstruct the input signal. We adopt best practices from the state-of-the-art to encode the sequence by an LSTM, jointly learnt with a decoder to reconstruct the signal, with the aid of GAN critics. Uncertainty is estimated end-to-end by means of a hyperbolic neural network. By using uncertainty, HypAD may assess whether it is certain about the input signal but it fails to reconstruct it because this is anomalous; or whether the reconstruction error does not necessarily imply anomaly, as the model is uncertain, e.g. a complex but regular input signal. The novel key idea is that a detectable anomaly is one where the model is certain but it predicts wrongly. HypAD outperforms the current state-of-the-art for univariate anomaly detection on established benchmarks based on data from NASA, Yahoo, Numenta, Amazon, Twitter. It also yields state-of-the-art performance on a multivariate dataset of anomaly activities in elderly home residences, and it outperforms the baseline on SWaT. Overall, HypAD yields the lowest false alarms at the best performance rate, thanks to successfully identifying detectable anomalies.
