I am a PhD student in computer science at the Sapienza University of Rome, where I am also a member of the <a href='https://www.pinlab.org'>Perception and Intelligence lab (PINlab)</a> . 

My research focuses on artificial intelligence and computer vision, and I am particularly interested in topics such as 
- Procedural Learning,
- Egocentric Vision 
- Video Anomaly Detection, 
- Crowd Navigation, and 
- Hyperbolic Neural Networks. 

I am excited to work in these cutting-edge areas of computer science, and I look forward to making significant contributions to the field through my research

<!-- I strive to understand the World within and around me. 

As a **scientist**, I use birds, mainly shorebirds, to explore 
- <a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-41223-z'>rhythms of parental care</a> and <a href='https://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2019.00093'>how such rhythms emerge</a>, 
-  <a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/nature20563'>within- and between-species differences in rhythmicities</a> and what may drive such differences, as well as
- <a href='https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ele.13662'>distribution and evolution of traits across the globe</a>

**Currently**, I am investigating global differences in uniparental incubation of shorebirds, sperm trait differences in three genetically distinct morphs in the ruff, biorhythms of red knots and drivers of global variation in the song of songbirds.  

I am a **postdoc** at the [Max Planck Institute for Biological Intelligence](https://www.bi.mpg.de/en) and [Czech University of Life Sciences Prague](https://www.czu.cz/en) and **collaborate** with [scientists and institutions across the globe](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaw8529).
